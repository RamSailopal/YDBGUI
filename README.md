# YDBGUI

YottaDB GUI

Forked from https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/UI/YDBGUI

This particular fork contains additional code to integrate a bespoke application restart into the GUI. This can be found in the **Database Administration** "drop down" menu.

# Getting started

To run:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/RamSailopal/YDBGUI)

Locally - 

    git clone https://github.com/RamSailopal/YDBGUI.git
    cd YDBGUI
    docker run -dp 1338:1338 -p 8089:8089 -v $PWD/tools:/home/tools --entrypoint /home/tools/start.sh --name octo-vehu yottadb/octo-vehu:latest-master
    
# Set Up


The bespoke routine/line label is stored in the global/subscript:

    ^GUISYS("restart")
    
Change this to reference the startup iine/routine for your own application

# Example

A dummy routine **^TESTROUT** has been added to the setup in the routines directory as an example startup routine 

**RESTART^TESTROUT** hangs for 2 minutes and then reports a "clean" system start. 

**CRASH^TESTROUT** demonstrates a crashing startup process after 30 seconds, reporting the M error associated.

To replicate a "clean" and crashing restart, change **^GUISYS("restart")** accordingly
