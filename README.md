<hr>

# Getting started

To run:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/RamSailopal/YDBGUI)

Locally - 

    git clone https://github.com/RamSailopal/YDBGUI.git
    cd YDBGUI
    docker run -dp 1338:1338 -p 8089:8089 -v $PWD/tools:/home/tools --entrypoint /home/tools/start.sh --name octo-vehu yottadb/octo-vehu:latest-master
    
# Set Up


The bespoke routine/line label is stored in:

    ^GUISYS("restart")
    
Change this to reference the startup iine/routine for your own application

# Example

A dummy routine **^TESTROUT** has been added to the setup as an example startup routine **RESTART^TESTROUT** hangs for 2 minutes and then reports a "clean" system start. **CRASH^TESTROUT** demonstrates a crashing startup process, reporting the M error associated.
