## TESTING

The testing is performed by the means of standard Java Script testing tools: chai and puppeteer.
While chai manages the tests, puppeteer provides a headless Chrome browser with DOM access, to inspect graphic elements.

We test Client and Server independently, in the following way:

### Client

The Client testing is performed by generating different mock data in the `app.system` object, thus emulating multiple server responses scenario's. Each test number generates a different response, stimulating the interface to react according, so that we can inspect the graphic elements and determine the validity of the test.

### Server

The Server testing is not using the interface at all and is fully focused on the response returned by the REST call. By modifying the database structure, using OS or YDB MUPIP calls, we alter the REST response, so that we can analyze it and determine the validity of the test.
