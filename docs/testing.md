# Testing

In order to execute a test, you need to do the following:

- Create a docker image for development (see instructions inside the dockerfile)
- Entere the root of the application (`/YDBGUI`)
- Execute: `npm test` 


The testing documentation (located in /wwwroot/test/README.md) can be automatically regenerated by running the following commandat the prompt:

- Create a docker image for development (see instructions inside the dockerfile)
- Entere the root of the application (`/YDBGUI`)
- Execute: `npm run maketestdocs` 


It will traverse all the test files and replace the existing README.md file with a new (updated) version.
